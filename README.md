##Hi ðŸ‘‹ this is a simple password generator
* The password generator was built using Javascript
* When you click the button, you will be able to pick a password
    * Choose how many characters (between 8-128)
    * Choose if you would like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
* You can click the button again to go through it if you don't like this password
